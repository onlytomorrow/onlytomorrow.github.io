# Crackhead Jack Steam Version (CHJ-ST) change log

this'll just be a dump of a less comprehensive changelog, specifically for uploaded builds to Steam.

the short and lame descriptions are random, if nothing was written it's probably not important to you. A/B/C revs are usually fixing little mistakes i made before uploading. i'll try and be more descriptive for release

current build format (short for "steam 2020-07, update XX, rev AB") is super temporary and stupid and will be changed to the standard version.major.minor.rev for release versions
